# Art Generator - Monochromatic Blobs

This script generates dynamic and visually intriguing monochromatic blobs that move across the canvas following various mathematical functions. It serves as a creative coding project inspired by generative art.

## Features

- **Color Palettes**: The script utilizes a set of 10 monochromatic color palettes to create visually appealing blobs.
- **Interactive**: Blobs are generated on mouse click, each with a random position and color.
- **Mathematical Functions**: The movement direction of the blobs is determined by various mathematical functions, providing unique patterns.
- **Automatic Refresh**: The artwork is refreshed automatically after a set duration, introducing a new color palette and enhancing the generative aspect.

## Usage

1. **Mouse Click**: Click on the canvas to generate new blobs at the cursor position.
2. **Automatic Refresh**: The color palette and blobs automatically change after a set duration.

## Color Palettes

The color palettes used in this script are defined in the `colorPalettes` array. Each palette provides a distinct visual style to the generated blobs.

## Mathematical Functions

The movement of the blobs is influenced by mathematical functions, contributing to the dynamic and evolving nature of the artwork. Functions for both x and y coordinates are defined based on the `variation` parameter.

## How to Customize

Feel free to experiment and modify the code according to your creative vision. You can adjust parameters such as the number of blobs, color palettes, mathematical functions, and refresh duration.
